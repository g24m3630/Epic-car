Nitro-racing arcade game with jump boost

Nitro-racing game is a phone-based game released in the early 21st century and mass produced in Nokia phones. The game is classified as a runner game with a never-ending level. The game uses a car in the roadway as your playable character. 
The game’s objective is to stay clear of incoming cars as you drive in a straight path that has 2 – 4 lanes dodging left and right. The incoming vehicles appear randomly in the front of your car, and you must evade all of them. The player must dodge cars and when they reach a score of a multiple of 100 they get a nitro boost which allows them to crash into the opponent cars without dealing damage or losing the game. The duration of the nitro is approximately 30 seconds. 
The game can consist of multiple different versions that alternate such as a small hatchback, a truck, and a van. The vehicle changes lead to more ability required to ensure the path you choose is the correct one as you need to plan with enough space to manoeuvre around the next incoming barrage of vehicles.   
The game we plan to develop is a variation of the previous example which allows the user to jump over the incoming cars. This will replace the nitro in the previous version and allow for a more optional feel and riskier as the length of the jump needs to be calculated ahead of time as you can still receive damage or lose the game should you scrape or crash into the opposing cars. The game will also have variety of car selection in both make and model and possibly even colour. This game is a single player however you can compare the skill of players by their high scores. The high score will be the aim of the game as you play to prove that you are better than your friend/enemy/acquaintance. This is exactly what drove the game to be popular in its initial release and why it was so widely used and referenced in the newer non-stop games. 






3.	A clear “Problem Statement"
The aim of Nitro-racing is to obtain a highscore by avoiding incoming cars. The game has a low complexity, although the speed of the players car will increase and a nitro-boost feature will be added. Those features will slightly increase the complexity and depth of the game.
