And for mobile phone the player has to tap on the screen to make the bird flop its wings and fly upwards. 
Tools used:
	“java.awt”  – This contains the classes for creating user interface as well as painting graphics and images.
 The classes used for this game are: 
 - color : manages the colours in the graphical interface.
 -image: representation of the graphical images. 
 -font 
 -dimension: specifies the size of the images.

	“java.awt.event” – Provides the necessary clauses and interfaces for event handling. 
The classes used: 
-ActionEvent: indicates that a component – defined action has 			        	occurred.
- ActionListener: Adds interactivity in java applications by handling 			user actions. 
- KeyListener: allows program to respond to user input from the users 			keyboard.
- KeyEvent: encapsulates information about the key event.

	“javax.swing” – provides lightweight components that are used to create window-based applications. 
Classes used:
-	JFrame: represents a top level window with a title border.
-	JButton: implements events when clicked.
-	JPanel: hold and organises other components. 
-	Timer: implements action events in intervals to assist in repetitive tasks. 
	“java.util” – provides the collections framework, random number generations  and other utility classes.
Classes used:
-	Random: generates random numbers assisting in the random generation of the pipes in the game.
-	ArrayList: stores the lists for Pipe objects
